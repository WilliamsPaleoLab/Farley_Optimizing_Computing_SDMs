Many contemporary Big Data applications, such as the popular microblogging service Twitter (http://twitter.com), require distributed, parallel, streaming methods to identify key analytical trends in real time (e.g., Bifet, Holmes, Pfahringer, & Gavalda, 2011).

With the recent growth in monitoring and occurrence data, some ecological analysts apply similar, data-driven machine-learning techniques to ecological forecasting problems and have seen significant increases in predictive skill (Elith et al., 2006).

Moreover, common statistical forecasting methods can be computationally demanding, particularly on larger datasets (Huang et al., 2013). Climate-driven ecological forecasting models, variously called ecological niche models (Peterson, 2003), predictive habitat distribution models (Guisan & Zimmerman, 2000), and species distribution models (SDMs)(Guisan & Thuiller, 2005b), have seen extensive application in ecology, global change biology, evolutionary biogeography (Araújo, Whittaker, Ladle, & Erhard, 2005; Wilfried Thuiller et al., 2008a), reserve selection (Guisan et al., 2013), and invasive species management (Ficetola, Thuiller, & Miaud, 2007). SDMs characterize a species’ response to biospatial environmental gradients (Franklin, 2010), and use these responses to forecast potential future distributions under climate change scenarios. Recently, studies with an large number of occurrence records, along with computationally intensive modeling approaches, including nonparametric data-driven techniques (Elith et al., 2006) and Bayesian methods that rely on repeated sampling of full joint probability distributions (Clark et al., 2014; Dawson et al., 2016), have become commonplace.

Paleoenvironmental proxy data, including fossil pollen, macrofossils, and freshwater and marine diatoms, can be an important supplement to modern biodiversity data and are an important part of these emerging efforts.

Cloud computing may offer a technological solution to some of these problems (Hampton et al., 2013; Michener & Jones, 2012). Cloud computing is a architectural design pattern that provides “ubiquitous, convenient, and on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort” (Hassan, 2011; Mell & Grance, 2012; Vaquero et al., 2008). With the rapid commercialization of cloud computing and the widespread availability of public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCE), scientists have a seemingly unlimited supply of computing resources at their disposal. The cloud has been touted by many of the largest players in Silicon Valley, and is credited with Obama’s 2012 presidential election win, Netflix’s ability to provide streaming entertainment to millions of consumers, and Amazon’s massive success in online retailing (Mosco, 2014). In 2010, the U.S. Federal Government embraced the efficiency, speed, and economy of the cloud, requiring all federal agencies to adopt a “Cloud-First” policy when considering new information technology (IT) developments (Kundra, 2010). Accordingly, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have both officially endorsed cloud technology (Mosco, 2014). Researchers in many disciplines have posited that the cloud as the key to solving future computing and modeling challenges (Hsu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2011).
